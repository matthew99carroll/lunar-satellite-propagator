# Lunar Satellite Propagator

This program is an implementation of a 3DOF propagator for low-earth-orbit and lunar trajectories, and uses minimum energy Hohmann transfers to carry out the orbit raising. All equations used in this are derived from first principles.

## Assumptions

    - Mass of the satellite is constant i.e. not considering fuel expended during orbit changes.
    - The earth and the moon are in the same inclination, and all no inclination changes are considered.
    - Small amounts of friction in LEO are not considered.
    - Gravitational forces acting on the satellite are from only the Earth and the Moon.
    - The earth and the Moon are perfectly circular.
    - The satellite is a simple point mass.
    - The Moon's orbit around Earth is perfectly circular.

## Installation

You must have the following python libraries installed:

    - matplotlib
    - numpy

## Usage

Running propagate.py will run the main simulation loop.

Satellite parameters can be changed within the global_params.py file.
